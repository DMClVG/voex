# Vöx

A simple multiplayer sandbox voxel game/demo made with [LÖVE](https://love2d.org) using [g3d](https://github.com/groverburger/g3d) ❤️💚💙

This is a fork of [g3d_voxel](https://github.com/groverburger/g3d_voxel) that aims not to be particularly fast or minimal, but to be playable locally or remotely with other players.

The server and client operate using lua-enet, and there is (currently) no way play as singleplayer.

## Issues
If you face any problems, please open an issue. Thanks 

## How to run 

Clone this repository onto your machine with: 

`$ git clone https://github.com/DMClVG/voex.git voex`

To start the server, run:

`$ cd voex && love server [port]`

And for the client, do:

`$ cd voex && love client [address] [port] [username]`

Enjoy
